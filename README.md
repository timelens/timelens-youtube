Timelens userscript for YouTube
===============================

This userscript adds [Timelens](https://timelens.io)-like visual timelines to YouTube's video player.

It makes use of the thumbnails which YouTube generates for most videos. Because there are not many thumbnails for short videos, the visual timeline will look blurry for those. Also, some videos do not have thumbnails at all, so this userscript won't work there.

This userscript was originally written by [@fkloft](https://github.com/fkloft).

Installation
------------

1. Install a userscript manager for your browser, like [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome.
2. Open the raw [timelens-youtube.user.js](https://github.com/timelens/timelens-youtube/raw/master/timelens-youtube.user.js) file. Your plugin will offer to install it.
3. Now, whenever you're browsing YouTube, you should get a Timelens interface!
